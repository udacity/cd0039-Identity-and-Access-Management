"""HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) algorithm

HMAC is a MAC defined in RFC2104_ and FIPS-198_ and constructed using
a cryptograpic hash algorithm.
It is usually named *HMAC-X*, where *X* is the hash algorithm; for
instance *HMAC-SHA1* or *HMAC-MD5*.

The strength of an HMAC depends on:

 - the strength of the hash algorithm
 - the length and entropy of the secret key

This is an example showing how to *create* a MAC:

    >>> from Crypto.Hash import HMAC
    >>>
    >>> secret = b'Swordfish'
    >>> h = HMAC.new(secret)
    >>> h.update(b'Hello')
    >>> print h.hexdigest()

This is an example showing how to *check* a MAC:

    >>> from Crypto.Hash import HMAC
    >>>
    >>> # We have received a message 'msg' together
    >>> # with its MAC 'mac'
    >>>
    >>> secret = b'Swordfish'
    >>> h = HMAC.new(secret)
    >>> h.update(msg)
    >>> try:
    >>>   h.verify(mac)
    >>>   print "The message '%s' is authentic" % msg
    >>> except ValueError:
    >>>   print "The message or the key is wrong"
