"""Salsa20 stream cipher

`Salsa20`_ is a stream cipher designed by Daniel J. Bernstein.

Its key is by preference 256 bits long, but it can also work
with 128 bit keys.

As an example, encryption can be done as follows:

    >>> from Crypto.Cipher import Salsa20
    >>> from Crypto.Random import get_random_bytes
    >>>
    >>> key = b'*Thirty-two byte (256 bits) key*'
    >>> iv = get_random_bytes(8)
    >>> cipher = Salsa20.new(key, iv)
    >>> msg = iv + cipher.encrypt(b'Attack at dawn')
