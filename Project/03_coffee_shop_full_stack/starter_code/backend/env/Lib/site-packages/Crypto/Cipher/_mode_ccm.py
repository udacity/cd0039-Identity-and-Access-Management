    This is an Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (`AEAD`_) mode.
    It provides both confidentiality and authenticity.

    The header of the message may be left in the clear, if needed, and it will
    still be subject to authentication. The decryption step tells the receiver
    if the message comes from a source that really knowns the secret key.
    Additionally, decryption detects if any part of the message - including the
    header - has been modified or corrupted.

    This mode requires a nonce. The nonce shall never repeat for two
    different messages encrypted with the same key, but it does not need
    to be random.
    Note that there is a trade-off between the size of the nonce and the
    maximum size of a single message you can encrypt.

    It is important to use a large nonce if the key is reused across several
    messages and the nonce is chosen randomly.

    It is acceptable to us a short nonce if the key is only used a few times or
    if the nonce is taken from a counter.

    The following table shows the trade-off when the nonce is chosen at
    random. The column on the left shows how many messages it takes
    for the keystream to repeat **on average**. In practice, you will want to
    stop using the key way before that.
